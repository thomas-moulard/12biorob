\section{Future work and conclusion}


This paper has discussed the difference between closed-loop trajectory
tracking on a mobile robot and on a humanoid
robot. Section~\ref{problem} demonstrates that even if this problem
may seem simple, a direct use of the mobile robots control schemes is
not realistic.  Section~\ref{closedloop} suggests a new strategy which
takes into consideration the humanoid robot specificities, in
particular the need to alter contact points.


Section~\ref{exp} provides an illustration of an experiment where the
HRP-2 robot follows a trajectory and achieve a result which would be
impossible using an open loop scheme, validating the proposed
approach.


However, additional work is needed to perfect this strategy: the
heuristic step validation should be replaced by a better criteria and
maintaining a precise localization during a long movement is still a
problem. Additionnally, this work should be integrated with more
complex movements to validate the generality of this approach.
