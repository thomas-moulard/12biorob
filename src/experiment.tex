\section{Experimental results}
\label{exp}


The proposed method has been validated on HRP-2 using the following
scenarii: the robot walks in a narrow and constrained environment
while stepping over obstacles. The trajectory length is
$2.5\mathrm{m}$ and is executed in approximately $40\mathrm{s}$.


This setup demonstrates that the execution using this control scheme
is precise and reliable. The robot reaches its goal position with an
error of a few centimeters whereas open loop control schemes is off by
more than a meter. Moreover, the control scheme is reliable: during
the movement, the localization precision can change, the robot
position tracking can fail\ldots The control scheme is designed to be
robust toward these situations.


This experiment uses the pattern generator described by
\cite{10icra.perrin} and the stack of tasks formalism
\cite{09icar.mansard} to implement the control scheme. The pattern
generator provides reference trajectories for the center of mass and
the feet. Trajectory following tasks for these particular bodies are
then inserted into the control framework. Computing the control such
as the tasks are satisfied is then realized by the solver.


This experiment video is available on the
web\footnote{\mbox{\url{http://homepages.laas.fr/tmoulard/video/11icra-tmoulard.mp4}}}. Fig.~\ref{fig:scenario}
provides an overview of the scenario: the robot starts on the right
side and walks toward the left side.


The final position precision depends on the localization precision and
the steps difficulty. In the proposed scenario, there is not occlusion
in order to insure a good localization. On the opposite, the long
steps as the one executed on this movement are prone to large
execution errors. In this context, the planned final position is
reached with a precision of $\pm 2 \mathrm{cm}$. This trajectory has
been executed five times consecutively with any obstacle collision.
Using a different footsteps sequence with smaller steps, the planned
position can be reached with an error lower than $1 \mathrm{cm}$.
